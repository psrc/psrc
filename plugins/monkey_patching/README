= Monkey Patching Plugin

The monkey patching plugin allows you to apply simple changes to Radiant source code by droping them in a file in the RAILS_ROOT/patches directory. It's recommended that you prefix patch file names with a number so that you can control the order in which they are applied:

  patches/
    01_site_controller_patch.rb
    02_export_patch.rb
    03_...

There is nothing magical about patches. They contain Ruby code that may make modifications to the Rails framework or Radiant itself. Use them wisely. Normally it's best to package up your changes in a plugin, but monkey patching is useful for the quick and dirty hack.
