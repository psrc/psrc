= Shards

Created by: Sean Cribbs, September 2007

The Shards extension creates insertion points called "regions" into the admin
UI.  Other extensions can modify these regions by adding or removing partials
in order to customize the UI and provide new or modify existing functionality.

Regions are accessed via the "admin" object within an extension class.  If I
wanted to add a partial to the top of the page editing screen, I would do
so like this:

  # Within the context of my extension class
  def activate
    admin.page.edit.add :main, "fuzzy_bears", :before => "edit_header"
  end

The "fuzzy_bears" partial name is relative to the Admin::PageController, so it
should exist inside the app/views/admin/page directory in the extension.

More details can be found on the Radiant wiki:
