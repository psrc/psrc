= Multi Site

Created by Sean Cribbs, November 2007. Inspired by the original virtual_domain
behavior.

Multi Site allows you to host multiple websites on a single Radiant
installation.

Each site has its own independent sitemap/page-tree and these attributes:

  name: Whatever you want to call the site
  domain: A Ruby regular expression (without the //) to match the request
          against
  base_domain: A canonical domain name for doing quicker matches and for
               generating absolute URLs against
  homepage_id: The numerical database ID of the root page (usually
               you can just leave this alone).

Included images are slightly modified from FamFamFam Silk Icons by Mark James:
