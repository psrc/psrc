= Related Content

Created by Sean Cribbs, October 2007

Provides a way to relate pages to one another externally.  This allows you to
generate a list of links to other pages of relevance, like so:

h3. See also
<r:related:each>
 * <r:link />
</r:related:each>

The interface uses Ajax to retrieve matching pages based on the words you type
and adds them to the list when you select one.  Related pages can be removed
by clicking the name or "minus" icon next to the name.  Pages are not 
reciprocally related; if Page B is in Page A's related content list, Page A
may or may not be in Page B's related content list.

*** This extension requires the "shards" extension! ***
