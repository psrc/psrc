<p>Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS that‘s used to describe
 the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant
  syntax for CSS and implements various features that are useful for creating manageable stylesheets.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Whitespace active</li>
    <li> Well-formatted output</li>
    <li> Elegant input</li>
    <li> Feature-rich</li>
</ul>

<h4>CSS Rules</h4>
<p>
Rules in flat CSS have two elements: the selector (e.g. &quot;main&quot;,
&quot;div p&quot;, &quot;li a:hover&quot;) and the attributes (e.g.
&quot;color: 00ff00;&quot;, &quot;width: 5em;&quot;).
</p>

<p>
Sass has both of these, as well as one additional
element: nested rules.

</p>
<h3>Rules and Selectors</h3>
<p>
However, some of the syntax is a little different. The syntax for selectors
is the same, but instead of using brackets to delineate the attributes that
belong to a particular rule, Sass uses two spaces
of indentation. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  #main p
    &lt;attribute&gt;

    &lt;attribute&gt;

    ...
</pre>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>
The syntax for attributes is also slightly different. The colon is at the
beginning of the attribute, rather than between the name and the value, so
it&#8216;s easier to tell what elements are attributes just by glancing at
them. Attributes also don&#8216;t have semicolons at the end; each
attribute is on its own line, so they aren&#8216;t necessary. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  #main p
    :color #00ff00
    :width 97%

</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:

</p>
<pre>
  #main p {
    color: #00ff00;
    width: 97% }
</pre>
<h3>Nested Rules</h3>
<p>
Rules can also be nested within each other. This signifies that the inner
rule&#8216;s selector is a child of the outer selector. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  #main p
    :color #00ff00
    :width 97%

    .redbox
      :background-color #ff0000
      :color #000000

</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:

</p>
<pre>
  #main p {
    color: #00ff00;
    width: 97%; }
    #main p .redbox {
      background-color: #ff0000;
      color: #000000; }
</pre>
<p>
This makes insanely complicated CSS layouts with lots of nested selectors
very simple:
</p>
<pre>
  #main
    :width 97%

    p, div
      :font-size 2em
      a
        :font-weight bold

    pre
      :font-size 3em
</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:

</p>
<pre>
  #main {
    width: 97%; }
    #main p, #main div {
      font-size: 2em; }
      #main p a, #main div a {
        font-weight: bold; }
    #main pre {
      font-size: 3em; }

</pre>
<h3>Attribute Namespaces</h3>
<p>
CSS has quite a few attributes that are in &quot;namespaces;&quot; for
instance, &quot;font-family,&quot; &quot;font-size,&quot; and

&quot;font-weight&quot; are all in the &quot;font&quot; namespace. In CSS,
if you want to set a bunch of attributes in the same namespace, you have to
type it out each time. Sass offers a shortcut for
this: just write the namespace one, then indent each of the sub-attributes
within it. For example:

</p>
<pre>
  .funky
    :font
      :family fantasy
      :size 30em
      :weight bold
</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:
</p>

<pre>
  .funky {
    font-family: fantasy;
    font-size: 30em;
    font-weight: bold; }
</pre>
<h2>Constants</h2>
<p>
Sass has support for setting document-wide
constants. They&#8216;re set using an exclamation mark followed by the
name, an equals sign, and the value. An attribute can then be set to the
value of a constant by following it with another equals sign. For example:

</p>
<pre>
  !main_color = #00ff00

  #main
    :color = !main_color
    :p
      :background-color = !main_color
      :color #000000
</pre>
<p>

is compiled to:
</p>
<pre>
  #main {
    color: #00ff00; }
    #main p {
      background-color: #00ff00;
      color: #000000; }
</pre>
<h3>Arithmetic</h3>
<p>
You can even do basic arithmetic with constants. Sass recognizes numbers, colors, lengths (numbers with
units), and strings (everything that&#8216;s not one of the above), and
various operators that work on various values. All the normal arithmetic
operators (+, -, *, /, %, and parentheses for grouping) are defined as
usual for numbers, colors, and lengths. The &quot;+&quot; operator is also
defined for Strings as the concatenation operator. For example:


</p>
<pre>
  !main_width = 10
  !unit1 = em
  !unit2 = px
  !bg_color = #a5f39e

  #main
    :background-color = !bg_color
    p
      :background-color = !bg_color + #202020
      :width = !main_width + !unit1
    img.thumb
      :width = (!main_width + 15) + !unit2
</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:
</p>
<pre>
  #main {
    background-color: #a5f39e; }
    #main p {
      background-color: #c5ffbe;
      width: 10em; }
    #main img.thumb {
      width: 25em; }
</pre>
<h3>Colors</h3>
<p>
Not only can arithmetic be done between colors and other colors, but it can
be done between colors and normal numbers. In this case, the operation is
done piecewise one each of the Red, Green, and Blue components of the
color. For example:
</p>

<pre>
  !main_color = #a5f39e

  #main
    :background-color = !main_color
    p
      :background-color = !bg_color + 32
</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:
</p>
<pre>
  #main {
    background-color: #a5f39e; }
    #main p {
      background-color: #c5ffbe; }
</pre>
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>
Strings are the type that&#8216;s used by default when an element in a bit
of constant arithmetic isn&#8216;t recognized as another type of constant.
However, they can also be created explicitly be wrapping a section of code
with quotation marks. Inside the quotation marks, a backslash can be used
to escape quotation marks that you want to appear in the CSS. For example:


</p>
<pre>
  !content = &quot;Hello, \&quot;Hubert\&quot; Bean.&quot;

  #main
    :content = &quot;string(&quot; + !content + &quot;)&quot;

</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:
</p>
<pre>
  #main {
    content: string(Hello, &quot;Hubert&quot; Bean.) }
</pre>
<h3>Default Concatenation</h3>
<p>
All those plusses and quotes for concatenating strings can get pretty
messy, though. Most of the time, if you want to concatenate stuff, you just
want individual values with spaces in between them. Thus, in Sass, when two values are next to each other without
an operator, they&#8216;re simply joined with a space. For example:


</p>
<pre>
  !font_family = "sans-serif"
  !main_font_size = 1em

  #main
    :font
      :family = !font_amily
      :size = !main_font_size
    h6
      :font = italic "small-caps" bold (!main_font_size + 0.1em) !font_family
</pre>
<p>
is compiled to:
</p>
<pre>
  #main {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 1em; }
    #main h6 {
      font: italic small-caps bold 1.1em sans-serif; }
</pre>
