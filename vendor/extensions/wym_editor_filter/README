== Wym Editor Filter

Created by: Benny Degezelle - gorilla-webdesign.be
Version: 0.3.5

This filter adds a WYSIWYM editor to Radiant.
It is aware of and interacts with the paperclipped and preview extension, but these are not required.

== About WYMeditor

WYMeditor's main concept is to leave details of the document's visual layout, and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user as much comfort as possible (at least as WYSIWYG editors).

WYMeditor has been created to generate perfectly structured XHTML strict code, to conform to the W3C XHTML specifications and to facilitate further processing by modern applications.

== Requirements

If your Radiant is pre-0.6.7, you need the shards extension. See http://groups.google.com/group/radiantcms-dev/browse_frm/thread/d07f7fffd84b3ce0/5efa6fd6c2e1668e?lnk=gst&q=shards#5efa6fd6c2e1668e


== Installation

Run this rake command to copy all needed files into the public folder:

	rake radiant:extensions:wym_editor_filter:install

That's it! You should now have "Wym Editor" in the filters dropdown on the page edit screen. Selecting this will spawn a WYMeditor instance.
