== Installation and Setup

Radiant is a traditional Ruby on Rails application, meaning that you can
configure and run it the way you would a normal Rails application.

Once you have extracted the file into the directory where you would like
to install Radiant:

1. Edit config/database.yml making changes for your database setup.

2. Run the database setup script:

   % ruby db/setup.orb

3. Start it like a normal Rails application. To test execute:

   % script/server
   
   And open your Web browser on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).


== Support

Radiant is still in the development stages and has not been officially
released. Hopefully, this won't hinder you from jumping on board and
downloading it from the Subversion repository. To get started, head on over
to our Trac powered dev site at http://dev.radiantcms.org/.
