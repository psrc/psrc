== Welcome to Radiant

Radiant is a no-fluff, open source content management system designed
for small teams. It is similar to Textpattern or MovableType, but is
a general purpose content management system (not just a blogging
engine).

Radiant features:

* An elegant user interface
* The ability to arrange pages in a hierarchy
* Flexible templating with layouts, snippets, page parts, and a
  custom tagging language (Radius: http://radius.rubyforge.org)
* Special page-oriented plugins called behaviors
* A simple user management/permissions system
* Support for Markdown and Textile as well as traditional HTML
  (it's easy to create other filters)
* Operates in two modes: dev and production depending on the URL
* A caching system which expires pages every 5 minutes
* Built using Ruby on Rails (which means that extending Radiant is
  as easy as any other Rails application)
* And much more...


== License

Radiant is released under the MIT license and is copyright (c) 2006
John W. Long. A copy of the MIT license can be found in the LICENSE
file.


== Installation and Setup

Radiant is a traditional Ruby on Rails application, meaning that you
can configure and run it the way you would a normal Rails
application.

Once you have extracted the files into the directory where you would
like to install Radiant:

1. Create a MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite database for your Web site.

2. Create config/database.yml for your database setup. (There are
   several examples in the config directory.)

3. Run the database setup script:

     % script/setup_database production

4. Start it like a normal Rails application. To test execute:

     % script/server production
   
   And open your Web browser on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).
   
When using Radiant on a production system you may also need to set
permissions on the public and cache directories so that your Web server
can access those directories with the user that it runs under.

Once you've installed Radiant on your own Web site, be sure to add your
name and Web site to the list of radiant users:

http://dev.radiantcms.org/radiant/wiki/RadiantUsers


== Radiant Admin Interface

The administrative interface is available at /admin/. By default the
`setup_database` script creates a user called "admin" with a password of
"radiant".


== Support

The best place to get support is on the mailing list:

http://radiantcms.org/mailing-list/

There is also a Trac powered dev site available here:

http://dev.radiantcms.org/

Please Note: Before filing a ticket on the dev site discuss your question
or problem on the mailing list. This makes it much easier to manage
legitimate tickets.


Enjoy!
