== Welcome to Radiant

Radiant is a no-fluff, open source content management system designed
for small teams. It is similar to Textpattern or MovableType, but is
a general purpose content management system (not a blogging engine).

Radiant features:

 * An elegant user interface
 * Flexible templating with layouts, snippets, page parts, and a 
   custom tagging language (Radius: http://radius.rubyforge.org)
 * Extensible with special page-oriented plugins called behaviors
 * Support for Markdown and Textile as well as traditional HTML
   (other filters are easy to write)
 * Simple user management/rights system
 * Operates in two modes: dev and production depending on the URL
 * A caching system which expires pages every 5 minutes
 * Built using Ruby on Rails
 * And much more...

This is a prerelease version of Radiant.

== Installation and Setup

Radiant is a traditional Ruby on Rails application, meaning that you
can configure and run it the way you would a normal Rails
application.

Once you have extracted the files into the directory where you would
like to install Radiant:

1. Create a MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite database for your Web site

2. Edit config/database.yml making changes for your database setup

3. Run the database setup script:

   % ruby db/setup.rb production

4. Start it like a normal Rails application. To test execute:

   % script/server
   
   And open your Web browser on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).
   
When using Radiant on a production system you may also need to set
permissions on the public and cache directories so that your Web server
can access those directories with the user that it runs under.

Once you've installed Radiant on your own Web site, be sure to add your
name and Web site to the list of radiant users:

== Radiant Admin Interface

The administrative interface is available at /admin/. By default the
db/setup.rb script creates a user called "admin" with a password of
"radiant".
