Rails 2 Todo:

* Something is wrong with the code tracking whether or not nodes are expanded
  in the site map. The tests are passing now, but the expansion is not 
  preserved beyond 2 levels. -- COMPLETED (mislav)

* Update boot.rb and environment.rb. Make sure the templates that the radiant 
  command uses are updated as well. -- COMPLETED (sean)
  
* Make sure script/spec works or uses spec.opts by default without -O.
