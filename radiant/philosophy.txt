Pages
-----

Pages are the fundamental unit in Radiant. In order to keep things simple pages
will always represent physical pages on the Web server. That is, there is a one
to one mapping from URLs to pages. For each URL only one page maps to
that URL and vise versa. Pages should not be made into templates. Layouts serve
that purpose.

There is one exception to this: the virtual page. There are times when it is
necessary to map many URLs to one page. In this case it is acceptable to
implement a virtual page. The classic example of this is the archive behavior
indexes for years, months, and days. In this case 2004/, 2005/, and 2006/ all
map to the same year index page.
